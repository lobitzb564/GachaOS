He's doing in virtual machine, we can all just ssh onto the computer

If we make our own kernel, we can make it take up less space
Download developement tools
go to kernel.org and download source code for kernel closest to arch version - copy "tarball" url
Make a temporary directory to build kernel in
download file in directory and extract, then go to new directory
Use "make mrproper" to clean up source tree
Next, have to configure the kernel and tell it what to build
get configuration from original running in proc, find config.gz
extract from zcat and redirect to .config
-y feature compiled
-n feature excluded
-m feature loadable
Comment out Config-deubg ones
Check config file for everything with "make olddefconfig", will ask if missing
Use "make localmodconfig" to not change actual config on computer
use "make menuconfig" to customizing kernel
Can cut out useless stuff by space bar
Build Kernel:
"make -j" (Flag tells it to use multiple cores)
Takes a long time
switch to root user
build modules by using "make modules install"
copy kernel to root partition
generate init ram fs file with mkinitcpio -k (insert version) : 20:42
Copy System.map into /booy
Do a bunch of stuff with some files, not really imporatnt at this point, then reboot to test
